This repository demonstrates a potential runtime error in a Swift function designed to calculate the average of an array of Doubles. The function handles empty input gracefully by returning nil, but the provided example uses force unwrapping to print the result. This could cause a runtime crash if the input array is empty.  The solution showcases how to safely handle the optional return value.
